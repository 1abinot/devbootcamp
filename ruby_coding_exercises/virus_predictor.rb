   Input:
      This program calculates the spread of an epidemic based on three necesasry arguments:
      state of origin, population density, and population size.
      (The other two arguments: region & region spread, are unnecessary).
      The 50 states are accessable through loading it from the state_date file
      that is in the same directory.

   Output:
      User see a text with specifies the number of deaths and the rate of the spread
      in that particular state.  (This is shown after user initialize the instance from
      VirusPredictor class and call the method virus_effects)

   Bonus:
      Create a report for all 50 states, not just the 4 listed below.
      Is there a DRY way of doing this?

   Reflections: It's pretty niffy that I can load another file from the same directory and
                do an iterative loop to access each nested hash into the VirusPredictor program.
                Since we are moving into SQL and database next week, I can see the relationship between
                this exercise and the database management tool such as SQL.
                It is alright to write my own code to access the numeric data from
                STATE_DATA hash, but if I were to do it each time in the future, it becomes repetitive.
                For example, if I want to update the program to utilize the region and regional_spread,
                then I have to hand-code the iteration again.

                I can see why SQL was invented to solve this issue when we have size, reliablilty,
                and future updates to consider.
