## Introduction to Data Structure

### Examples of everyday data structures

1. english dictionary -  a list of sorted words
2. city map - geometric map data on an 2-D   plane, with scales and directions
3. cashbook - tabular schema

    A computer works with many kind of data.  How we organize structure and data matters.

### Formal definition:
**Data structure** is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently.

1. Mathematical/logical models
    abstract data types (ADT)
    + list
        + store a given number of elements of any type
        + read element by position
        + modify elements at a position
2. Implementation
    + arrays

### Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
Define data and operations, but no implementation:

  + arrays
  + linked list
  + stack
  + queue
  + tree
  + graph

Some points of consideration for each of these data types:  
    1.logical view  
    2. operations  
    3. cost of operations  
    4. implementation
